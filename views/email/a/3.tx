<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">Last email we discussed the ads that track you across the internet. But, did you know this tracking can actually cost you money?! <img class="emoticon" src="https://duckduckgo.com/assets/email/money3.png" style="max-width:20px; max-height:20px;" alt="money flying away"></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">Retailers are increasingly charging “personalized” or “dynamic” prices based on your online footprint. They manipulate prices, trying to charge you the max they think you’re willing to pay. You could be sitting right next to someone, looking at the same online product, and be charged more just because of a website you visited.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">You're probably familiar with how common this practice is in the airline industry. That's all thanks to Google's ITA QPX Software; which provides solutions to airlines to price "by market segment, point-of-sale, channel and <a href="https://www.itasoftware.com/solutions/qpx/">even user</a>." </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">And the dynamic pricing trend only continues to grow more and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/06/cookie-monsters-why-your-browsing-history-could-mean-rip-off-prices">more aggressive</a>! If you haven’t installed a browser add-on or use a mobile browser that blocks tracking, such as <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app">our extension and app</a>, then now might be a good time.</p>
