<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">Unless you use a private search engine, like DuckDuckGo, then your search engine still likely has a copy of everything you've ever searched.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">Let's take Google for example. Check out your <a href="http://history.google.com/history">Google Search History</a>.&nbsp;Searches, locations, interests. They've recorded it all. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">Deleting your Google search history will prevent it from being used by the highest bidder on the millions of sites and apps that use Google's advertising networks.</p> 
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">To delete the results you can click on the dots on the top-right hand of the page and select "<em>Delete Activity By..</em>" then, select "<em>All Time</em>" and hit delete.</p>
