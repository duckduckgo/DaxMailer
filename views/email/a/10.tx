  <b>Privacy Mythbusting #1:</b> <em>Nobody else cares about privacy!</em> (Umm, yes they do.)
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">
  When was the last time you spoke with your friends or family about internet privacy? Sadly, for most people, the answer is <em>never</em>. In general, people believe that only a small percentage of people care about privacy, and while we know that isn't true, it is something that keeps most people from talking about privacy. <img src="https://duckduckgo.com/assets/email/emoji/dontspeak.png" style="height:24px;vertical-align:-7px;" alt="Monkey covering its mouth" />

  In Jan 2017, the <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS42253017">IDC found</a> that 84% of consumers expressed concern for their personal information, and 70% reported greater concern than just a few years ago.

  And itâ€™s not all talk. <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/privacy-settings-survey/">Over 20% of people</a> are using tracker blocking software, and many are taking other measures as well such as using DuckDuckGo. People are taking <em>action</em>.

  So maybe you didn't share DuckDuckGo because you thought no one would care? But, now that you know most people do, it is time to stand up and spread the word.

  <strong>Challenge</strong>: <a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com/spread">Share DuckDuckGo</a> with 3 friends or family members who you think deserve to be more private online. And no, your cat, "<em>Whiskers J. Snuggleworths the 3rd</em>" doesn't count!
