  <strong>Privacy Mythbusting #4:</strong> <em>I can't be identified just by browsing a website.</em> (If only!)
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">
  When we first released <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/is-private-browsing-really-private/">our study on private browsing modes</a>, a lot of people were shocked to see that websites could <em>still track them</em> even when they blocked cookies and used private browsing (aka "incognito mode").

  To see for yourself, check out <a href="http://nothingprivate.ml">Nothing Private</a>, an example site that showcases private browsing tracking in the real world. <img src="https://duckduckgo.com/assets/email/emoji/eye.png" style="height:14px;vertical-align:-2px;" alt="Emoji of an eye" />

  The main method used to uniquely identify and track people while using private browsing is called "browser fingerprinting." Just as each person has a unique fingerprint, so does every browser. Websites can look at version numbers of your browser, the plugins it uses, and dozens of other points of browser information to create a unique ID, a <em>browser fingerprint</em>, that can then be used to track you.
