<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">Computers, smartphones and internet-connected gadgets have made our lives easier to the point where we'd be stuck without them. The flip side is the more we rely on them, the more data passes through them and potentially out of our control. Sadly, these devices are often poorly privacy protected, for example a <a href="https://duo.com/blog/duo-analytics-android-device-security-article">2016 study of Android devices</a> showed a shocking 34% of users don't even have a passcode set! <img src="https://duckduckgo.com/assets/email/emoji/sad.png?atb=<: $subscriber.flow :>" style="max-width:24px;vertical-align:middle;" alt="" /></p>
