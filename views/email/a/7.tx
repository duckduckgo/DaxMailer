<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">We learned how to delete your ad settings, prevent price manipulation, and how to afford a pony.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">The best part is, if you've followed along on this email series, you've now reduced your online footprint - that's something worth celebrating!</p>
