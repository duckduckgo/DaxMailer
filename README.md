# DaxMailer
Subscriber management and email scheduling

## SYNOPSIS

Runs on perl 5.16+. Install dependencies with [Carton](https://metacpan.org/pod/Carton).

```sh
make test
```

## Schema Changes

When you have changed the DBIC schema, you will need to change the `$VERSION` in `lib/DaxMailer/Schema.pm`.
Then you can generate SQL diffs with the script:

```bash
carton exec bin/schema_generate.pl
```

Then you will need to deploy them like so:

```bash
carton exec bin/db_migrate.pl
```

New files in sql/ should be committed to git. You may make changes to these files after they are generated,
but if you run `schema_generate.pl` again these changes will be overwritten.

The `db_migrate.pl` script should also be run on each deployment to pull in new changes.
It is idempotent, so should be safe to run every time.
